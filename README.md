## Making a plan
1) Make a plan for the quest! The title is called Tales unto Dusk.
2) There will be a starting page where the user inputs are stored for the rest of the game.
3) On Index.html it will have a form with different labels. I will have the player choose from 3 classes. Fighter, Mage, and Rogue. I want each class to have different HP than the other classes. The file will have a Name label, class label, and karma?(This will be an extra add in if I have time.) Then will have a submit button to store the data.
4) I have Folders to seperate different files from each other for better organization. A folder for my quest data, a map folder for My map with quest links and locations. A quest folder for how I want the quets to be rendered and look on the page. A styles folder that holdes my css for each of my html files.  
5)States that need to be initialized are the different quests from my quest data and how and when it will be rendered on the html file depending on user's choice.
6) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?
7) Think about how to validate each of your steps
8) Consider your data model. What objects will you be using? What are the key/value pairs? What arrays do you need? What needs to live in local storage?
9) Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.
